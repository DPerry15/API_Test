# API_Test

- Couldn't access the data in the API
    - Forgot to use the API Key üòê
    - Labeled the endpoint wrong
    - Forgot to import the json packs at the start
- Ran into many issues of not knowing full python commands
    - Consulted google MANY MANY times to help understand the python language and understand how to actually implement the functions and each piece of data.
- When creating the methods as listed before I couldn't get the data to change to the proper format
    - Ended up using the wrong indexing and used google to help understand the syntax more
- Couldn't get the data to display properly
    - After getting the data saved ran into the issue of not having it display properly because it kept saving into the wrong spots
        - Added one extra index by accident and messed up all of the formatting.
- When creating the methods decided to turn it into one method and just have it goto the random endpoint if users input was random
    - This was done to make the code less duplicative and less code in general.

 (Alot of my issues were just not understanding full python commands)
